I have a web app idea I'd like to develop. Here's my initial concept:

{{IDEA}}

I'm looking to collaborate with you to turn this into a detailed project request. Let's iterate together until we have a complete request that I find to be complete.

After each of our exchanges, please return the current state of the request in this format:

```request
# Project Name
## Project Description
[Description]

## Target Audience
[Target users]

## Desired Features
### [Feature Category]
- [ ] [Requirement]
    - [ ] [Sub-requirement]

## Design Requests
- [ ] [Design requirement]
    - [ ] [Design detail]

## Other Notes
- [Additional considerations]
```

Please:
1. Ask me questions about any areas that need more detail
2. Suggest features or considerations I might have missed
3. Help me organize requirements logically
4. Show me the current state of the spec after each exchange
5. Flag any potential technical challenges or important decisions

We'll continue iterating and refining the request until I indicate it's complete and ready.
