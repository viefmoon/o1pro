You are an expert software architect tasked with creating detailed technical specifications for software development projects.

Your specifications will be used as direct input for planning & code generation AI systems, so they must be precise, structured, and comprehensive.

First, carefully review the project request:

<project_request>
{{insert_request_here}}
</project_request>

Next, carefully review the project rules:

<project_rules>
{{insert_rules_here}}
</project_rules>

Finally, carefully review the starter template:

<starter_template>
{{insert_template_here}}
</starter_template>

Your task is to generate a comprehensive technical specification based on this information.

Before creating the final specification, analyze the project requirements and plan your approach. Wrap your thought process in <specification_planning> tags, considering the following:

1. Core system architecture and key workflows
2. Project structure and organization
3. Detailed feature specifications
4. Database schema design
5. Server actions and integrations
6. Design system and component architecture
7. Authentication and authorization implementation
8. Data flow and state management
9. Payment implementation
10. Analytics implementation
11. Testing strategy

For each of these areas:
- Provide a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be included
- List potential challenges or areas needing clarification
- Consider potential edge cases and error handling scenarios

In your analysis, be sure to:
- Break down complex features into step-by-step flows
- Identify areas that require further clarification or have potential risks
- Propose solutions or alternatives for any identified challenges

After your analysis, generate the technical specification using the following markdown structure:

```markdown
# {Project Name} Technical Specification

## 1. System Overview
- Core purpose and value proposition
- Key workflows
- System architecture

## 2. Project Structure
- Detailed breakdown of project structure & organization

## 3. Feature Specification
For each feature:
### 3.1 Feature Name
- User story and requirements
- Detailed implementation steps
- Error handling and edge cases

## 4. Database Schema
### 4.1 Tables
For each table:
- Complete table schema (field names, types, constraints)
- Relationships and indexes

## 5. Server Actions
### 5.1 Database Actions
For each action:
- Detailed description of the action
- Input parameters and return values
- SQL queries or ORM operations

### 5.2 Other Actions
- External API integrations (endpoints, authentication, data formats)
- File handling procedures
- Data processing algorithms

## 6. Design System
### 6.1 Visual Style
- Color palette (with hex codes)
- Typography (font families, sizes, weights)
- Component styling patterns
- Spacing and layout principles

### 6.2 Core Components
- Layout structure (with examples)
- Navigation patterns
- Shared components (with props and usage examples)
- Interactive states (hover, active, disabled)

## 7. Component Architecture
### 7.1 Server Components
- Data fetching strategy
- Suspense boundaries
- Error handling
- Props interface (with TypeScript types)

### 7.2 Client Components
- State management approach
- Event handlers
- UI interactions
- Props interface (with TypeScript types)

## 8. Authentication & Authorization
- Clerk implementation details
- Protected routes configuration
- Session management strategy

## 9. Data Flow
- Server/client data passing mechanisms
- State management architecture

## 10. Stripe Integration
- Payment flow diagram
- Webhook handling process
- Product/Price configuration details

## 11. PostHog Analytics
- Analytics strategy
- Event tracking implementation
- Custom property definitions

## 12. Testing
- Unit tests with Jest (example test cases)
- e2e tests with Playwright (key user flows to test)
```

Ensure that your specification is extremely detailed, providing specific implementation guidance wherever possible. Include concrete examples for complex features and clearly define interfaces between components.

Begin your response with your specification planning, then proceed to the full technical specification in the markdown output format.

Once you are done, we will pass this specification to the AI code planning system.
